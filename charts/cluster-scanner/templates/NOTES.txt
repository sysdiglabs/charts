The Cluster Scanner component is being executed.

It consists of the Runtime Status Integrator and Image Sbom Extractor components.

After successful installation you can access the Cluster Scanner features as follows:

Log in to Sysdig Secure (at the URL: {{ include "cluster-scanner.apiHost" . }}) and check that the features are working as expected.
  1. Select Scanning > Image Results.
  2. Check for scanned container image results that originate with the Sysdig Cluster Scanner.

Please note that the first results will be available at least 15 minutes after Cluster Scanner has started.
