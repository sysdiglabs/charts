## Install Sysdig Using Helm

Sysdig leverages the power of the Helm open-source package manager for Kubernetes applications. 

If you are installing, configuring, or upgrading Sysdig components on a Kubernetes environment, use the Helm charts in this repository. 

## Core Component Charts

To install the core components of Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure, use the **sysdig-deploy** parent chart, which invokes a variety of child charts as needed. 

Additional Sysdig Secure components provide scanning for vulnerabilities in various parts of the environment and the CI/CD lifecycle.

| Parent Chart                                   | Subcharts                                              | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`sysdig-deploy`](/charts/sysdig-deploy)       |                                                        | Installs, configures, and upgrades the Sysdig Agent and a variety of Sysdig Secure components. The parent chart deploys multiple child charts. |
|                                                | [`cluster-shield`](/charts/cluster-shield)             | Deploys the Sysdig Cluster Shield in your Kubernetes cluster. The Sysdig Cluster Shield streamlines the deployment, management, and configuration of the Sysdig suite of security and compliance tools at the cluster level. |
|                                                | [`sysdig-agent`](/charts/agent)                        | Processes syscall events, metrics and creates capture files. It provides detailed visibility into container and host activity, helping to detect and prevent threats. |
|                                                | [`node-analyzer`](/charts/node-analyzer)               | The `node-analyzer` deploys the following as one daemonset in a cluster: <br>`host-scanner`<br>`runtime-scanner`<br>`kspm-analyzer` |
|                                                | [`kspm-collector`](/charts/kspm-collector)             | Collects Kubernetes resource manifests and sends them to be evaluated against Sysdig compliance policies. The scan results are displayed in Sysdig Secure [Compliance](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/compliance/) and [Inventory ](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/inventory/)UI. |
|                                                | [`host-scanner`](/charts/node-analyzer)                | A component deployed in the `node-analyzer` chart to scan [hosts](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities/runtime/host-scanning/) to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities with rich context. |
|                                                | [`runtime-scanner`](/charts/node-analyzer)             | A component deployed in the `node-analyzer` chart to scan Kubernetes [workloads](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities/runtime/) in runtime to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities with rich context. |
|                                                | [`admission-controller`](/charts/admission-controller) | Intercept creation and modification of Kubernetes resources for auditing, and, for legacy scanning engine, allows blocking requests based on image vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. |
|                                                | [`rapid-response`](/charts/rapid-response)             | Allows designated advance users to investigate and troubleshoot events from a remote shell. |
| [`registry-scanner`](/charts/registry-scanner) |                                                        | Scan images in [container registries](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/vulnerabilities/registry/) to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities with rich context. |
| [`cloud-connector`](/charts/cloud-connector)   |                                                        | Used only in special cases when the standard way of [connecting cloud accounts to Sysdig Secure](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/cloud-accounts-secure/) using Terraform or CloudFormation Templates will not work. <br/>Use this method only if recommended by your Sysdig account manager. |

## Legacy Charts

The following charts are kept in the repository for existing users but are in legacy status and are not recommended for fresh deployments.
